# well i have little experience of programming so if i had infite skills 
it would be to have infinite programming skills so that i can be more 
advanced so that i dont struggle, one of my goal for this class is to gain
new skills and learn as much as i can, and if i had infinite skills i
would build a gaming system that is so fast that you would not have to
worry about overheating or crashing
i want to be able to program as soon as i can but i know it takes time
and patience to learn and master this
